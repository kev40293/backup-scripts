add config option for number of backups before each full
   change partal/full to -- options and default to N partials
   before each full

Dry run capability

optional encryption (GPG?)

Better error handling (Failure or ignore?)
   error 1 means file modification
   error 2 from tar means directory checksum error (subdir deleted before directory finished)

GOALS

0.3:
   Unit Tests
   Test cases for configparser, argparser, delete, recover
   Configurable # of partials before full
